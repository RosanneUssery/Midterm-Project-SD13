<dt>Spring Tool Suite</dt>
  <dd>This is the IDE we will use to create the back end and front end web content for the application</dd>
<dt>GitHub</dd>
  <dd>Using GitHub to maintain version control and share information and work as a team will allow us to complete the tasks and work together to collaborate on the project</dd>
<dt>HTML5 and JSP</dt>
  <dd>We will use HTML5 and JSP to create the backbone of the customer-facing web interface.

Our goal with building this application is to create a website that will allow users to exchange and request equipment and supplies between Colorado Micro Sanctuaries. This will provide a service to the community by facilitating greater communication and resource sharing between MicroSanctuary groups.

> Description here for the MicroSanctuary thing

This application will be our SD13 midterm group project. It will allow us to practice the skills we have learned so far, gain greater confidence with the technologies, and deepen our understanding of core software development concepts.

In order to achieve these goals, we will be using group project and agile methodologies to work together and create a product. We will be using scrum techniques to keep on track and make sure we meet all of the project's goals.
